Bespin Presentation
===================

These disorganized files constitute the Bespin presentation given by me on July 15th, 2010. Feel free to use as you wish!

Notes
=====

Bespin does not load unless the file is accessed via http. file:/// protocol will cause Bespin to fail.

In the presentation I was using a local development version of Bespin running on the dryice tool that ships with Bespin Embedded. That is NOT included in this package. You can get it from Mozilla Labs' download site.
